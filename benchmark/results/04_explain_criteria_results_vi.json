      "response": "Sure! Here's a simple and clear explanation of the eligibility criteria for this prostate cancer trial:\n\n---\n\n### Who Can Join (Inclusion Criteria)\n\nYou may be able to participate if:\n\n- **You are 18 years or older.**  \n- **You have been diagnosed with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of your body** (like your bones or organs).  \n- **Your cancer has gotten worse despite hormone therapy** (which lowers testosterone). This worsening can be shown by:\n  - An increase of at least 20% in the size of your tumors on scans, or new tumors appearing.\n  - Or, new spots showing up on a bone scan.\n  - Or, your blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) — a marker for prostate cancer — has gone up twice in a row, with the second test being higher than the previous one, and your PSA level is at least 5.  \n- **Your blood tests are within certain limits** (your kidney, liver, and blood cell counts are good enough).  \n- **Your testosterone level is very low** (less than 50 ng/dL), meaning your hormone therapy is working.  \n- **You are willing to keep taking hormone therapy** (like GnRH drugs) during the study, unless you've had your testicles removed.  \n- **Your blood counts are healthy enough** (enough white blood cells and platelets).  \n- **You are able to do daily activities fairly well** (Karnofsky score of 70% or higher).  \n- **At least 4 weeks have passed** since your last radiation therapy (or at least 1 week if it was a small, targeted dose).  \n- **At least 4 weeks have passed** since you last took any experimental drugs.  \n- **You have recovered from any side effects of previous treatments** (to a mild level).  \n- **You agree to keep your current bone-strengthening medicines (like bisphosphonates or denosumab) the same during the study.**  \n- **If you are taking more than 10 mg of prednisone (a steroid) daily,** you are willing to reduce it to 10 mg for at least a week before starting and keep it there during the study.  \n- **You give your written permission** to participate after understanding what the study involves.\n\n---\n\n### Who Cannot Join (Exclusion Criteria)\n\nYou should NOT participate if:\n\n- **You have already received chemotherapy for prostate cancer.**  \n- **You recently had hormone treatments (other than the hormone therapy mentioned above) within the last 28 days.**  \n- **You have taken part in a previous study involving a drug called custirsen.**  \n- **You have brain metastases or cancer spread to the brain,** whether treated or not.  \n- **You have a spinal cord compression that needs urgent treatment.** (If it was treated successfully and not getting worse, you might still be able to join.)  \n- **You have another active cancer** (except for some skin or superficial bladder cancers that are not currently needing treatment).  \n- **You have serious health problems** like uncontrolled heart failure, recent heart attack, uncontrolled high blood pressure, recent stroke, or a serious infection.  \n- **You are planning to join another clinical trial** at the same time.  \n- **You are pregnant or breastfeeding.** (Not mentioned here, but generally important.)  \n\n---\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- This trial is for men with advanced prostate cancer that has gotten worse despite hormone therapy.\n- You need to be in good enough health to handle the treatment.\n- Always talk with your doctor to see if you meet these criteria and if this trial is right for you.\n\n---\n\nIf you're interested, discuss these points with your healthcare provider to get a final answer!",
