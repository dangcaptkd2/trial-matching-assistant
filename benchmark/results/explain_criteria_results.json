There’s no upper age limit, so even older adults can participate.\n- **You haven't had chemotherapy for leukemia before**, except for a medicine called hydroxyurea, which is used to control very high white blood cell counts.\n- **You are not pregnant or nursing.** Women who could become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test within 3 days before joining.\n- **Women who could get pregnant and men must agree to avoid pregnancy** during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose. Women should use reliable birth control methods, and men should use condoms.\n- **You give your written permission** to participate in the study after understanding what it involves.\n\n---\n\n### Who Cannot Join (Exclusion Criteria):\n\n- **If your leukemia has certain specific genetic features** (like certain chromosome changes or mutations), you cannot join.\n- **If your leukemia has other genetic mutations** (like NPM1 or FLT3 mutations), you cannot participate.\n- **If your overall health is poor** (for example, if your heart, liver, or kidneys are not working well), you cannot join.\n- **If you have an active infection** that is not under control, you cannot participate.\n- **If you have serious neurological or mental health issues** that prevent you from understanding or giving consent, you cannot join.\n- **If you have another active cancer** (besides some skin cancers that are not serious), you cannot participate.\n- **If you are HIV positive**, you cannot join.\n- **If you have a bleeding disorder** that is not related to leukemia, you cannot participate.\n- **If you do not agree to allow your medical information to be used for research** or to share with your doctors involved in your care, you cannot join.\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes:\n- If you're unsure whether you meet these criteria, it's best to talk with your doctor. They can help determine if this trial is right for you.\n- The goal of these rules is to make sure the treatment is safe for you and that the results of the study are accurate.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like more details or help understanding anything!",

Here's a simple, clear explanation of the eligibility criteria for the prostate cancer trial NCT01188187:\n\n---\n\n### Who Can Join (Inclusion Criteria):\n\n- **You must be at least 18 years old.**  \n- **You have prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of your body.**  \n- **Your cancer has gotten worse despite hormone therapy, and you need chemotherapy.**  \n- **Your cancer shows signs of progression through scans or blood tests, such as:**  \n  - An increase in the size of tumors seen on scans, or  \n  - New spots showing up on bone scans, or  \n  - Your PSA blood test (a marker for prostate cancer) has gone up twice in a row, with the starting PSA being at least 5.  \n- **Your blood tests are within certain limits:**  \n  - Your kidney function is okay,  \n  - Your liver tests are normal,  \n  - Your testosterone level is very low (less than 50 ng/dL).  \n- **You are willing to keep taking hormone therapy (like GnRH drugs) during the study, unless you've had your testicles removed.**  \n- **Your blood counts are good enough:**  \n  - You have enough white blood cells and platelets.  \n- **You are able to do daily activities reasonably well (Karnofsky score of 70% or higher).**  \n- **It's been at least 4 weeks since your last cancer treatment, and you've recovered from any side effects.**  \n- **You agree not to change your current bone-strengthening medicines during the study unless side effects require it.**  \n- **If you're taking steroids like prednisone, your dose must be reduced to 10 mg or less a day before starting the study.**  \n- **You must give your written permission to participate.**\n\n---\n\n### Who Cannot Join (Exclusion Criteria):\n\n- **You have already had chemotherapy for prostate cancer before.**  \n- **You recently had other hormone treatments (besides the hormone therapy mentioned above) within the last 4 weeks.**  \n- **You took part in a previous study involving a drug called custirsen.**  \n- **You have brain metastases or cancer spread to the brain, whether treated or not.**  \n- **You have serious spinal cord compression or other urgent issues needing surgery or radiation.**  \n- **You have another active cancer (except for some skin or superficial bladder cancers that don’t need treatment).**  \n- **You have serious health problems like uncontrolled heart failure, recent heart attack, uncontrolled high blood pressure, recent stroke, or active infections.**  \n- **You are planning to join another experimental study or trial at the same time.**\n\n---\n\n### Important Notes:\n- If you're unsure whether you meet these criteria, it's best to talk with your doctor. They can help determine if you're a good fit for this study.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify anything further!",
