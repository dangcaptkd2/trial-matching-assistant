      "response": "Sure! Here's a simple and clear explanation of the eligibility criteria for trial NCT01188187, which is about testing treatments for men with prostate cancer:\n\n**Who Can Participate (Inclusion Criteria):**\n\n- You must be 18 years or older.\n- You need to have a confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of your body (like bones or organs).\n- Your cancer has gotten worse despite hormone therapy (which lowers testosterone). This worsening can be shown by:\n  - An increase in the size of your tumors on scans, or new tumors appearing.\n  - New spots showing up on bone scans.\n  - Your PSA blood test (a marker for prostate cancer) has gone up at least twice in a row, with the first reading being at least 5.0.\n- Your blood tests must be within certain limits, meaning your kidneys, liver, and blood counts are working well enough.\n- Your testosterone level must be very low (less than 50 ng/dL), meaning your hormone therapy is working.\n- You agree to keep taking hormone therapy (like GnRH drugs) during the study unless you've had your testicles removed.\n- You need to have enough healthy blood cells and good overall health to handle the treatment.\n- You should be able to do daily activities reasonably well (Karnofsky score of 70% or higher).\n- At least 4 weeks should have passed since your last cancer treatment like radiation, and 4 weeks since any experimental drugs.\n- You should have recovered from any side effects of previous treatments to a mild level.\n- If you're taking steroids (like prednisone), your dose should be reduced to 10 mg or less per day before starting the study.\n- You must give your written permission to participate.\n\n**Who Cannot Participate (Exclusion Criteria):**\n\n- If you've already had chemotherapy for prostate cancer, you can't join.\n- If you've recently had hormone treatments (other than the ones required for the study) in the last 28 days, you can't join.\n- If you've taken part in certain other prostate cancer studies before, you can't join.\n- If you have brain metastases (cancer spread to the brain) or meningeal cancer, you can't join.\n- If you have serious spinal cord compression needing urgent treatment, you can't join unless it's been treated successfully.\n- If you have another active cancer (except some skin or superficial bladder cancers), you can't join.\n- If you have serious health problems like uncontrolled heart issues, recent heart attack, stroke, or serious infections, you can't join.\n- If you're planning to join another experimental study at the same time, you can't join this one.\n\n**Important:** If you're unsure whether you qualify, it's best to talk with your doctor. They can help you understand if this trial is right for you.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more details or help with anything else!",
