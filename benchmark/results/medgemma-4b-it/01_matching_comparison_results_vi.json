Here are some potential matches:\n\n1.  **Role of FSH in Human Gonadal Development**\n    NCT ID: NCT00064987\n    Match Score: 0.90\n    Reasoning: The patient meets all inclusion criteria (no history of spontaneous puberty, clinical hypogonadism, infantile testes, no reproductive hormone therapy except testosterone, complete absence of normal LH pulses, normal anterior pituitary, negative MRI). The patient does not meet the exclusion criteria (no prior therapy with gonadotropins).\n\n2.  **Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Pulsatile Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone Pump Treatment in Patients With Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism**\n    NCT ID: NCT02310074\n    Match Score: 0.50\n    Reasoning: The patient is 19 years old, which meets the age requirement. They have low testosterone and low GnRH, which could be consistent with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. However, the testosterone level is not below 166ng/dl, and the GnRH is low, which is not explicitly stated as a requirement. Further information is needed.\n\n3.  **24-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Study in Hypogonadal Men Receiving Testosterone Replacement Therapy**\n    NCT ID: NCT04274894\n    Match Score: 0.50\n    Reasoning: The patient has decreased pubic hair and low testosterone, which are symptoms of hypogonadism. However, the patient's testosterone level is within the normal range (65 ng/dL), and the patient has not had two testosterone levels confirmed to be below 300 ng/dL. The patient also has low GnRH, which is a symptom of hypogonadism. The patient does not have any known medical conditions that would exclude them from the trial.\n\n4.  **Effect of PROGRESSive Resistance Training, Protein Supplements and Testosterone in Older Frail Men With Testosterone Deficiency (PROGRESS Trial)**\n    NCT ID: NCT02873559\n    Match Score: 0.50\n    Reasoning: The patient has low testosterone (65 ng/dL) and low GnRH, which are inclusion criteria. However, the patient's testosterone level is not below 10 nmol/L, and the patient has no prostate cancer or other exclusion criteria listed.\n\n5.  **Autonomic Manifestations of Testosterone Deficiency in Men**\n    NCT ID: NCT02715713\n    Match Score: 0.50\n    Reasoning: The patient's testosterone level is 65 ng/dL, which is below the 277 ng/dL threshold.
