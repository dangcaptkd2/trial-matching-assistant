Her BMI is within the acceptable range. She has regular menses, and the trial requires a diagnosis of infertility. The patient's history of multiple partners and inconsistent contraception use suggests potential infertility. |  |\n| 0.80 | Prospective, Randomized Trial Comparing Luteal Phase Ovarian Stimulation, and Luteal Estradiol Priming Protocol for Patients With Diminished Ovarian Reserve - The LUTEAL Trial | NCT04447872 | The patient meets age, menstrual cycle regularity, and ovarian presence criteria.
