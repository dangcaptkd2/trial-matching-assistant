All listed trials concern unrelated conditions (renal lymphoma, maternity housing, adrenal myelolipoma, intellectual disabilities, maternal depression). There is essentially no relevance to the patient’s condition or the user’s request beyond the generic fact of listing trials.",

It fails to find or even acknowledge appropriate musculoskeletal/hand surgery or ganglion cyst studies and instead lists entirely unrelated trials, so it is effectively non-responsive to the clinical need."
