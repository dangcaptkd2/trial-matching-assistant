          "detailed_description": "The purpose of this study is to see if infliximab is safe and effective in treating GCA.\r\n      Currently, the only treatment for GCA is prednisone. GCA is a long lasting inflammatory\r\n      disease. The cause is unknown. It may affect all the arteries, but it focuses on the big\r\n      vessels such as those around the heart, the vessels in the neck and head, and their major\r\n      branches. It can lead to vision loss, blindness, stroke, stenosis (narrowing of blood\r\n      vessels) and aneurysms (a weakening in the lining of the blood vessel wall, which may\r\n      eventually lead to rupture of the blood vessel). The damage to the arteries is caused by an\r\n      immune response. A naturally occurring substance in the immune system called \"tumor necrosis\r\n      factor alpha\" (TNFa) plays a significant role in this immune response against the blood\r\n      vessels. This response is thought to cause the long-lasting inflammation (irritation and\r\n      swelling of the vessels). By blocking the effect of TNFa we think that we may reduce the\r\n      signs and symptoms associated with GCA. This trial will study patients who are stable on\r\n      prednisone treatment by evaluating whether infliximab can control their symptoms as the dose\r\n      of prednisone is reduced. Patients will receive infusions of either 5mg/kg of infliximab or\r\n      placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46. Safety evaluations will be performed at\r\n      specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs\r\n      (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and the occurrence and severity of adverse\r\n      events as well as other study specific procedures. Patients will receive receive infusions of\r\n      either 5mg/kg infliximab or placebo infusions at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 22, 30, 38, and 46.",

This study will evaluate the effectiveness of abatacept in treating GCA and TAK and\r\n      preventing disease relapse.",
          "detailed_description": "GCA and TAK both cause inflammation in the lining of the arteries, which can interfere with\r\n      the body's ability to carry oxygen to areas that need it. Symptoms of GCA include headaches,\r\n      jaw pain, and blurred or double vision. Serious symptoms that occur less commonly are\r\n      blindness and stroke. TAK symptoms include fever, fatigue, weight loss, arthritis, and\r\n      non-specific aches and pains. There may also be tenderness near affected arteries.\r\n      Researchers believe that GCA and TAK are diseases that are controlled by the body's immune\r\n      system. Activated T-cells, specifically, are critical to the origin and development of these\r\n      diseases. Abatacept is a medication that modulates the signal required for T-cell activation.\r\n      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of abatacept in treating GCA and TAK\r\n      and preventing disease relapse.\r\n\r\n      Participation in this study may last up to 4 years. Participants will receive abatacept\r\n      intravenously on specified days during Months 1, 2, and 3.

At Month 3, participants who\r\n      have achieved remission will be randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to either\r\n      continue abatacept or be switched to placebo infusions. Both treatments will be given once a\r\n      month at study visits. Blood samples will also be collected at the monthly study visits to\r\n      conduct laboratory-based studies.

The diagnosis is\r\n      based on leveling biopsies taken from the rectum and colon. Treatment is supportive if\r\n      complications had arisen, and surgical for definitive correction of the pathophysiological\r\n      condition which is the cause of the disease. Currently, clinicians rely on histopathology,\r\n      for diagnosing the disease, and planning surgical correction. The main goal of Surgical\r\n      treatment will be the creation of a continuous patent and innervated bowel, in which\r\n      effective propulsive peristalsis is taking place. This is achieved by resection of\r\n      aganglionic colon, and anastomosis of normal colon with normal ganglia, to anus. Today\r\n      surgeons await histopathology report for the diagnosis of Hirschsprungs disease, and frozen\r\n      section biopsies taken when in surgery to ascertain the level of ganglionated bowel.\r\n\r\n      In this study the investigators aim to correlate electrophysiological reading, from colon\r\n      suspected of Hirschsprungs disease. If correlation is found, or a specific pattern which is\r\n      diagnostic of the disease may be found, the electrophysiological study may offer a new way of\r\n      diagnosing the disease, which is not invasive and allows prompt diagnosis in contrast to\r\n      histopathology which is time consuming. A reliable electrophysiological study for\r\n      Hirschsprungs disease may be helpful in early and correct diagnosis, with a noninvasive\r\n      procedure as compared to a biopsy of the colonic wall. Children with chronic constipation,\r\n      suspected of having hirschsprungs disease, who are admitted for rectal biopsy will be\r\n      included in the study. During the procedure, electrophysiological reading from the site\r\n      chosen for biopsy will be done. Correlation between electrophysiological data and\r\n      histopathology will be analyzed.

Recruited women will be randomised to either receive the\r\n      prediction score (intervention arm) or not (control arm).",
          "detailed_description": "Intrauterine pregnancy of uncertain viability (IPUVI) affects 10-28% of women seen in the\r\n      Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit (EPAU). Such women have a pregnancy correctly sited within\r\n      the uterus but the viability of the pregnancy cannot be determined at the initial scan. This\r\n      finding may represent a normally developing (but early) pregnancy. However, approximately 50%\r\n      of these pregnancies will eventually miscarry. The current recommendation from The National\r\n      Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is to offer a confirmatory scan after 14\r\n      days.\r\n\r\n      This 14-day interval is particularly distressing for women and diagnostic uncertainty in\r\n      early pregnancy is associated with heightened levels of anxiety and depression. NICE Evidence\r\n      Update 71 (2014) suggests that provision of more information about the likely outcome of the\r\n      pregnancy (prior to the repeat ultrasound) may benefit psychological health.\r\n\r\n      The investigators have previously developed, validated and published a mathematical tool to\r\n      predict pregnancy viability after diagnosis of IPUVI (549 participants). The tool (which\r\n      takes account of maternal age, vaginal bleeding score and ultrasound measurements) is\r\n      established as an accurate research tool having been externally validated in a different test\r\n      population. Having established its performance, the investigators would like to provide women\r\n      with this individualised prediction of their pregnancy outcome. If psychologically beneficial\r\n      (and not harmful) this tool may help up to a third of the EPAU population.\r\n\r\n      This will be a single centre, prospective non-blind randomised control study. All eligible\r\n      women with IPUVI ultrasound classification at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital will be\r\n      identified and invited to be recruited to the study.\r\n\r\n      Following recruitment, a woman will be randomised by random computer generator to either\r\n      Group I (intervention group - receive the prediction score) or Group II (control group - do\r\n      not receive the prediction score).\r\n\r\n      Potential participants will be identified on a daily basis by those that regularly perform\r\n      ultrasound scans within the department; sonographers, nurse specialists, research fellows and\r\n      consultants. Once identified, they shall be approached by the local researcher for a\r\n      face-to-face consultation who will confirm their eligibility criteria and explain the study.\r\n      In addition, the detailed patient information sheet (PIS) will be provided before taking\r\n      informed written consent. Clinicians who perform ultrasound scans out of hours, will be\r\n      notified of the study and asked to inform eligible women about the study and obtain consent\r\n      for the local researcher to contact them the next working day.\r\n\r\n      Written, informed consent will be taken prior to recruitment from all participants. It will\r\n      clearly state that the participant is free to withdraw from the study at any time for any\r\n      reason without prejudice to future care, and with no obligation to give the reason for\r\n      withdrawal.\r\n\r\n      It is estimated that a total of 250 women will be recruited (125 participants in each group).\r\n      Data will be collected from all women at three points during the course of the study. A\r\n      single, validated scale will be used for data collection regarding psychological well-being.\r\n      The questionnaire to be used is the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) by Zigmond\r\n      and Snaith (1983).\r\n\r\n      Each questionnaire will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. The questionnaires will\r\n      be sent to participants via email (or post if participants do not have access to email). If a\r\n      participant does not initially respond the researcher may send one reminder email and contact\r\n      them by telephone on one occasion with prior consent from the participant. If the participant\r\n      does not respond following these reminders they will be withdrawn from the study. The local\r\n      researcher will monitor the progress of each participant's pregnancy prior to sending out the\r\n      questionnaires. Women who are known to have undergone termination of pregnancy prior to\r\n      completion of all three questionnaires will be withdrawn from the study and not contacted\r\n      with further questionnaires.\r\n\r\n      Participants in Group I will also be invited to complete a patient experience questionnaire\r\n      at the end of the study period to assess their perceived acceptability and usefulness of the\r\n      tool. This has been developed specifically for this study using modified versions of the\r\n      Technology Acceptance Model (Davis et al 1989).\r\n\r\n      The potential benefits of the study are outlined. This study will confirm whether this\r\n      prediction tool is of clinical and psychological benefit to the patient.\r\n\r\n      Women may find the questionnaires they are asked to complete prompt them to seek help earlier\r\n      for conditions which may otherwise have gone untreated such as anxiety and depression. In\r\n      addition, they may find it therapeutic to be able to express their opinions, emotions and\r\n      feelings during the period of uncertainty.\r\n\r\n      If the study shows that the prediction tool is acceptable to patients (as well as being\r\n      accurate in terms of the actual pregnancy outcome) this will allow units to more\r\n      appropriately triage follow-up plans were resources are limited.\r\n\r\n      Following the study, it is anticipated that the use of the tool could be extended to other\r\n      clinical sites to aid the management and expectations of women diagnosed with IPUVI. The NICE\r\n      Evidence Update specifically refers to this prediction tool and it is anticipated that this\r\n      will be a nationally recommended tool if validated in this study.\r\n\r\n      In terms of potential risks or burdens involved, there will be no physical risks incurred by\r\n      participation in the study. Recruited women will not be expected to have any additional\r\n      visits to the hospital during the study, over and above usual care. The investigators are\r\n      aware that when conducting a study of anxiety symptoms, it could potentially identify a woman\r\n      with an undiagnosed mental health condition, issues of self-harm or potential harm to others.\r\n      The principal investigator will check the survey responses regularly and will highlight any\r\n      responses which are of serious concern. The investigator will then contact the woman directly\r\n      to discuss her responses. The participant will be encouraged to see the General Practitioner\r\n      (GP) if deemed necessary. If the participant does not wish to see the GP or there is\r\n      persistent concern from the local researcher the confidentiality clause may need to be broken\r\n      in the interest of safety of the participant and others. The local researcher will then\r\n      contact the GP directly after informing the participant of their intended actions, to report\r\n      these concerns.It is possible that the participants will not perceive any individual benefit\r\n      from participating in this study. It is possible that the women will not perceive any\r\n      individual benefit from participating in this study.\r\n\r\n      A statistician will be consulted to assist in analysis of the data collected from the study.\r\n\r\n      To calculate the sample sizes, power calculations were performed on the HADS scale. Puhan et\r\n      al (2008) report the minimal important difference in HADS scores is 1.5 units for a\r\n      significance level of 0.05 and a statistical power of 80% when considering an intervention.\r\n      Based upon this assumption and a common standard deviation of 4 points, 125 women are needed\r\n      for each group (total 250 women). A drop-out rate of 10% is anticipated.\r\n\r\n      The following statistical analyses will be performed:\r\n\r\n      Descriptive statistics will be used to compare the two groups in terms of baseline\r\n      demographic characteristics. Continuous variables normally distributed will be described\r\n      reporting mean and standard deviation, otherwise median and interquartile range will be used.\r\n      Categorical variables will be reported with frequency tables. To compare HADS scores between\r\n      groups I and II, the t-test will be performed for continuous variables normally distributed,\r\n      otherwise the Mann-Whitney U test will be used. The Chi-squared test will be used for\r\n      categorical variables.\r\n\r\n      A statistically significant difference will be considered as a p-value <0.05. The data will\r\n      be checked for abnormalities, spurious and missing data. These will be coded separately and\r\n      treated accordingly. Analyses will be carried out using Stata statistical software, Release\r\n      14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).\r\n\r\n      Throughout the study (and afterwards), the research investigators will welcome inspections\r\n      and monitoring of the conduct of the research to ensure that the quality of the research is\r\n      upheld and that the agreed practice is being adhered to. This includes offering direct access\r\n      to any documents.\r\n\r\n      Data will be stored on secure computers at the specific hospital conducting the study using\r\n      password protected access to databases. Hard copy data (consent and registration forms) will\r\n      be stored within the unit site files which will be kept in secure areas.",

          "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:The inclusion criterion was the presence at transvaginal ultrasound of\r\n        an extraovarian adnexal mass in women with a suspected ectopic pregnancy (amenorrhea,\r\n        bleeding and pain) with positive test for beta-hCG.\r\n\r\n        -\r\n\r\n        Exclusion Criteria:The exclusion criterion was non-tubal ectopic pregnancy (cervical,\r\n        cesarean scar, ovarian, and abdominal).\r\n\r\n        -",
          "brief_summary": "OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\r\n      concentrations in women with ectopic pregnancy (EP), abnormal intrauterine pregnancy (aIUP)\r\n      and normal intrauterine pregnancy (nIUP).\r\n\r\n      METHODS: This was a prospective, case-control study comparing serum VEGF concentrations among\r\n      72 women with ectopic pregnancy (n=35), abnormal IUP (n=15) and normal IUP (n=22) matched for\r\n      gestational age. For the determination of serum VEGF concentration a solid phase sandwich\r\n      ELISA was used. Patients were stratified according to serum VEGF above or below 200pg/mL.\r\n\r\n      RESULTS: The serum level of VEGF was significantly higher in women with ectopic pregnancy\r\n      (median 211.1 pg/mL; range 5 - 1017.0 pg/mL) than in women with normal IUP (median 5 pg/mL;\r\n      range 5- 310.6 pg/mL) P < 0.0001. Serum VEGF concentrations did not show any statistically\r\n      significant difference between women with aIUP (median 231.9 pg/mL range 5 - 813.7 pg /mL )\r\n      and EP (median 211.1 pg/mL range 5 - 1017.0 pg/mL). When cut-off concentrations of 200 pg/mL\r\n      for VEGF were used, a nIUP could be distinguished from an unviable (EP and aIUP) with a\r\n      sensitive of 53%, specificity of 90.9%, a positive predictive value of 92.9% and a negative\r\n      predictive value of 46.5%..\r\n\r\n      CONCLUSIONS: Serum VEGF could not distinguish between an EP and an aIUP. However, serum VEGF\r\n      concentrations above 200 pg/mL could discriminate a nIUP from an unviable pregnancy (EP or\r\n      aIUP) with a PPV of 92.9%.",

It\r\n      is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for\r\n      maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility\r\n      that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A\r\n      specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of\r\n      DMD/BMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally\r\n      delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the\r\n      nonsense mutation.

          "detailed_description": "High blood pressure affects a third of the United States population; it is one of the most\r\n      common health problems in this country. With proper treatment, including weight loss, diet,\r\n      exercise, or medication, individuals can usually maintain adequate blood pressure control. A\r\n      large percentage of people, however, do not have their blood pressure under sufficient\r\n      control. Prompting individuals to ask their doctors specific medical questions has proven\r\n      effective in improving overall preventive medical care, but its effect on blood pressure\r\n      control among hypertensive individuals has not been evaluated. \"My Expert Doctor\" is a\r\n      web-based program that helps patients to ask the right questions regarding specific tests and\r\n      treatments during their doctor visits. Upon entering medication and treatment information\r\n      into the web site, patients are provided with individualized feedback and recommended\r\n      questions to ask their doctor. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of\r\n      the individualized, web-based intervention in improving blood pressure control in individuals\r\n      with high blood pressure.\r\n\r\n      Both physicians and their patients will be enrolled in this 1-year study. Participating\r\n      physicians will be randomly assigned to either the web-based intervention group or a control\r\n      group. Recruitment materials describing the study will be mailed to their patients who have\r\n      high blood pressure. Eligible patient participants will attend a baseline study visit, which\r\n      will include blood pressure measurements and self-report questionnaires. Patient participants\r\n      in the intervention group will receive access to the interactive section of the web site for\r\n      1 year. They will have the ability to enter their medication history, blood pressure\r\n      measurements, and blood test results. This information will then be analyzed against a\r\n      database containing the National Institutes of Health (NIH) blood pressure control\r\n      guidelines. Questions that participants may want to ask their physician, reasons for asking\r\n      the questions, and links to reputable web sites (e.g., American Heart Association) will then\r\n      be displayed. Automated email reminders will encourage participants to use the web site on a\r\n      monthly basis and prior to any doctor visits. Participants in the control group will be given\r\n      access to an area of the web site that does not provide individualized feedback, but does\r\n      contain information related to the prevention of high blood pressure. Baseline evaluations\r\n      will be repeated at a Year 1 study visit. Study researchers will review participants' medical\r\n      records to analyze serum creatinine test results and blood pressure measurements during the\r\n      1-year study and 1 year prior to the study.",

          "brief_summary": "Zenker's Diverticulum (ZD) is a sac-like outpouching of the lining of the esophageal wall at\r\n      the upper esophagus. It is a rare disease typically seen in the middle-aged and older adults.\r\n      Common symptoms of the disease include difficulties in swallowing (dysphagia), food reflux\r\n      (regurgitation), unpleasant breath smells (halitosis) and couch, choking and hoarseness etc.\r\n      (respiratory complications). Pills lodging in the sac and thus unable to take effect is also\r\n      a common and yet often overlooked problem.\r\n\r\n      Traditional treatment for ZD included open resection done by head and neck surgeons and\r\n      direct septum division done by ENT doctors. Septum division done by endoscopists is a new\r\n      modality of treatment and so far has used the same approach as the ENT doctors-the wall\r\n      between the sac and the normal esophageal lumen (the septum) is cut down directly so that\r\n      food will not be held in the sac.\r\n\r\n      A cutting-edge endoscopic treatment for ZD is now emerging. In this approach, what we call\r\n      submucosal tunneling endoscopic septum division (STESD), the wall is not cut directly, but\r\n      inside a tunnel created by lifting the wallpaper (the mucosa lining the esophageal wall).\r\n      After the muscle septum is completely cut, the mucosa is then sealed by clips, restoring\r\n      integrity of the esophageal lining.\r\n\r\n      The advantage of STESD is twofold. First, the esophageal mucosa will be sealed after the\r\n      operation, so that the chance of extravasation of luminal content with its relevant\r\n      complications will be smaller. Second, under the protection of the tunnel, the endoscopist\r\n      will be able to cut the septum completely down to its bottom, ensuring a more satisfactory\r\n      symptom resolution. In short, our hypothesis is that treating Zenker's diverticulum by the\r\n      tunneling endoscopic technique should be both safer and more effective than traditional\r\n      methods.",
          "detailed_description": "Patients with symptomatic Zenker's diverticulum are considered for STESD. The diagnosis is\r\n      based on clinical presentation, barium swallow, EGD and a swallow test to rule out other\r\n      possible disorders causing cervical dysphagia. A scoring system (Costamagna, GIE, 2016) is\r\n      used to evaluate severity of the symptoms. Four symptoms are evaluated: 1) dysphagia, 2)\r\n      regurgitation, 3) daytime respiratory symptoms and 4) nighttime respiratory symptoms. These\r\n      are scored based on a solid food diet according to the symptom frequency calculated within 2\r\n      consecutive weeks: 0-never, 1-1day/ week, 2-2~4days/ week, 3-≥5 days/ week. Under EGD and\r\n      barium swallow test, configuration of the diverticulum is documented in detail (Shou-Jiang\r\n      Tang, Laryngoscope, 2008). Quality of life is assessed using the SF-36 form. The pre- and\r\n      post-STESD symptom score, quality of life score, and diverticulum configuration are compared.\r\n\r\n      Adverse events are recorded and graded according to the system suggested by the ASGE workshop\r\n      (Cotton, GIE, 2010).",

          "brief_summary": "Lung cancer is the most common cancer in men and the fourth most common cancer in women\r\n      worldwide. Until today no effective method permits the early detection of lung cancer.\r\n      Consequently, lung cancer is often diagnosed owing to symptoms of advanced disease. To\r\n      address this problem, detection methods with an improved sensitivity and specificity are\r\n      urgently needed.\r\n\r\n      Over the past decade, accumulating evidence shows that the metabolism of cancer cells differs\r\n      from that of normal cells. More specifically, the entire metabolism of cancer cells is\r\n      reorganized or reprogrammed to increase anabolic reactions that induce cell growth and\r\n      survival. Metabolic reprogramming during the development of cancer is driven by aberrant\r\n      signaling pathways due to the activation of oncogenes and the loss of tumor suppressor genes.\r\n      Furthermore, the microenvironment of the tumor plays a role in metabolic reprogramming. The\r\n      altered cancer metabolism is characterized by an increased glycolysis, the production of\r\n      lactate and the biosynthesis of macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids and nucleotides.\r\n      Cancer cells have a high glycolytic rate and eliminate most of the glucose-derived carbon as\r\n      lactate rather than oxidizing it completely via oxidative phosphorylation, a phenomenon known\r\n      as the Warburg effect. The breakdown of glucose and other nutrients leads to a high energy\r\n      production and provides the Krebs cycle with intermediates, which consequently are allocated\r\n      to metabolic pathways that support biosynthesis. Metabolites are the end products of cellular\r\n      metabolism and are therefore closely related to the observed phenotype. Disturbances in\r\n      biochemical pathways which occur during the development of cancer consequently provoke\r\n      changes in the metabolic phenotype. As a result, low-molecular weight metabolites are very\r\n      attractive biomarkers for different cancer types. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\r\n      spectroscopy enables the identification and quantitative analysis of complex mixtures of\r\n      metabolites, as in plasma and serum, without an extended sample preparation.\r\n\r\n      The present study aims to determine the metabolic phenotype of lung cancer by means of proton\r\n      (1H)-NMR spectroscopy. Once the phenotype determined (training cohort), this has to be\r\n      validated by an independent cohort.",
          "detailed_description": "Subjects Subjects with lung cancer detected by a computed tomography (CT)-scan and referred\r\n      to a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT-scan are included. The diagnosis of lung cancer is\r\n      confirmed by means of an pathological biopsy or by a medical doctor specialized in oncology\r\n      with respect to radiological or clinical data. The control group consists of subjects who\r\n      were referred to the department Nuclear Medicine for an examination of the heart. This\r\n      control group represents the average population, consists of healthy subjects and patients\r\n      with non-cancer diseases and did not undergo a PET/CT-scan. Exclusion criteria are as\r\n      follows: (1) not fasted for at least 6 hours, (2) poorly controlled diabetes (fasting plasma\r\n      glucose concentration ≥ 200 mg/dl) in cancer patients, (3) medication intake at the day of\r\n      blood sampling and (4) treatment or history of cancer in the preceding 5 years.\r\n\r\n      The training cohort consists of 80 subject with lung cancer and 80 controls. The validation\r\n      cohort consist of 250 subject with lung cancer and 250 controls.\r\n\r\n      Blood sampling and processing Fasting venous blood samples (BD Vacutainer® LH 17 I.U. 10 ml\r\n      tube) are collected and stored at 4°C within 5 to 10 minutes. Around 8 hours after blood\r\n      collection, blood samples are transported on crushed ice to the central laboratory and\r\n      centrifuged at room temperature (swinging bucket centrifuge, 1600 g, 15 minutes).\r\n      Subsequently, 4 plasma aliquots of 500 µl are transferred into sterile cryovials and stored\r\n      at -80°C until examination within 6 months. When subjects give permission to store their\r\n      biological material, 3 aliquots are stored at the University Biobank Limburg (UBiLim) for\r\n      biomedical research purposes.\r\n\r\n      Prior to NMR analysis, plasma aliquots are thawed and homogenized using a vortex mixer. After\r\n      centrifugation at 13000 g for 4 minutes at 4°C (fixed rotor Eppendorf centrifuge 5415 R,\r\n      Hamburg, Germany), plasma aliquots are diluted in deuterium oxide (D2O, 99.9%, Cambridge\r\n      Isotope Laboratories Inc, Andover, USA) containing 180 µg/µl\r\n      trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionic acid (TSP, 98%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories\r\n      Inc, Andover, USA) as a chemical shift reference. Finally, the prepared plasma samples are\r\n      transferred into a 5 mm NMR tube and analyzed.\r\n\r\n      1H-NMR analyses and assignment of present resonances The 1H-NMR spectra are recorded on a 400\r\n      Megahertz (MHz) NMR spectrometer (Varian/Agilent, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Instruments,\r\n      Palo Alto, California, USA) with a magnetic field strength of 9.4 Tesla at 294 K. Slightly\r\n      T2- weighted spectra are acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence to\r\n      attenuate signals of macromolecules, such as proteins and polysaccharides. Additionally,\r\n      water suppression is performed in order to allow optimal detection and quantification of\r\n      low-molecular weight metabolites. The 1H-NMR spectra are phased manually, baseline corrected\r\n      and referenced to the TSP resonance at 0.015 parts per million (ppm). The assignment of the\r\n      present 1H-NMR resonances occurs by means of spiking experiments. A reference plasma sample\r\n      is alternately spiked with 34 known metabolites with a concentration of 1 mg compound per 100\r\n      µl plasma. The obtained chemical shifts are double checked with Chenomx NMR suite software\r\n      (Version 7.5, Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Finally, 1H-NMR spectra are divided\r\n      in 112 spectral regions, which are integrated and normalized relative to the total integrated\r\n      area of all spectral regions, irrespective of the remaining water, TSP, fructose and glucose\r\n      resonances. The end result corresponds to 110 normalized integration regions (all integration\r\n      regions except those of water and TSP).\r\n\r\n      Statistical analysis At first, the integration values of all 110 spectral regions are\r\n      analyzed by means of a student t-test with correction for multiple testing by\r\n      Benjamini-Hochberg to identify those which differ significantly between lung cancer patients\r\n      and controls (IBM SPSS Version 20.0, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Secondly, multivariate\r\n      statistical analyses are performed using SIMCA-P+ (Version 12.0, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) to\r\n      investigate whether the metabolic composition of blood plasma allows to discriminate between\r\n      lung cancer patients and controls. An unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) was\r\n      performed to identify intrinsic clusters and outliers within the dataset. After the removal\r\n      of outliers (detected by a Hotelling's T2 range plot), an orthogonal partial least squares\r\n      discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), an extension of partial least squares discriminant analysis\r\n      (PLS-DA) with an integrated orthogonal signal correction filter, is performed to remove\r\n      variability not relevant to class separation. The predicted classification is expressed as\r\n      specificity (the percentage of controls that are actually classified as controls) and\r\n      sensitivity (the percentage of lung cancer patients that are actually classified as lung\r\n      cancer patients). The outcome of using the integration values of the significantly different\r\n      spectral regions, obtained by the student t-test with correction for multiple testing by\r\n      Benjamini-Hochberg, is compared to the outcome in which the integration values of all 110\r\n      spectral regions were used.",
