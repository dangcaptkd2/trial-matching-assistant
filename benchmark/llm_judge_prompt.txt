You are an expert evaluator for clinical trial matching systems. Your task is to evaluate the quality of responses generated by a clinical trial matching assistant.

PATIENT PROFILE:
{patient_profile}

TRIALS FOUND (Top matches with reasoning):
{trials_info}

SYSTEM RESPONSE:
{response}

Evaluate the response on three criteria:

1. HALLUCINATION (1-5 scale):
   - 5: All information is grounded in the trial data, no made-up claims
   - 4: Mostly grounded, very minor unsupported details
   - 3: Some unsupported claims or embellishments
   - 2: Several hallucinations or made-up information
   - 1: Major hallucinations, fabricated trial details

2. ACCURACY (1-5 scale):
   - 5: All trials are highly relevant and perfectly match patient criteria
   - 4: Most trials are highly relevant, minor mismatches
   - 3: Mix of relevant and less relevant trials
   - 2: Many trials don't match well
   - 1: Trials are mostly irrelevant to patient profile

3. CLARITY (1-5 scale):
   - 5: Very clear, well-organized, easy to understand, professional
   - 4: Clear and understandable with minor areas for improvement
   - 3: Understandable but could be clearer or better organized
   - 2: Somewhat confusing or poorly structured
   - 1: Very confusing, hard to understand, poorly organized

Provide your evaluation as JSON:
{{
    "hallucination": <score 1-5>,
    "hallucination_reasoning": "<brief explanation>",
    "accuracy": <score 1-5>,
    "accuracy_reasoning": "<brief explanation>",
    "clarity": <score 1-5>,
    "clarity_reasoning": "<brief explanation>"
}}

Be objective and critical. Base hallucination scores strictly on whether claims are supported by the trial data provided.
