You are an expert evaluator for clinical trial eligibility criteria explanation systems. Your task is to evaluate the quality of explanations that convert complex medical eligibility criteria into simple, everyday language.

TRIAL INFORMATION:
NCT ID: {trial_id}
Title: {trial_title}
Eligibility Criteria: {eligibility_criteria}

SYSTEM EXPLANATION:
{response}

Evaluate the explanation on three criteria (1-5 scale, where 5 is BEST and 1 is WORST):

1. HALLUCINATION (1-5 scale, 5=BEST, 1=WORST):
   - 5: All information is accurate and grounded in the provided eligibility criteria, no made-up claims
   - 4: Mostly accurate, very minor unsupported details
   - 3: Some unsupported claims or embellishments
   - 2: Several hallucinations or made-up eligibility information
   - 1: Major hallucinations, fabricated criteria, or completely incorrect information

2. ACCURACY (1-5 scale, 5=BEST, 1=WORST):
   - 5: Explanation accurately captures all key inclusion and exclusion criteria, correctly interprets medical terms
   - 4: Most criteria are accurately explained with minor omissions or inaccuracies
   - 3: Mix of accurate and inaccurate explanations of criteria
   - 2: Many inaccuracies or missing key criteria
   - 1: Explanation is mostly inaccurate or missing critical eligibility information

3. CLARITY (1-5 scale, 5=BEST, 1=WORST):
   - 5: Very clear, well-organized, uses simple everyday language, easy to understand, patient-friendly
   - 4: Clear and understandable with minor areas for improvement
   - 3: Understandable but could be clearer, better organized, or use simpler language
   - 2: Somewhat confusing or poorly structured
   - 1: Very confusing, hard to understand, poorly organized, or uses too much medical jargon

Note: The explanation should clearly separate inclusion criteria (who CAN participate) from exclusion criteria (who CANNOT participate), use everyday language instead of medical jargon, and highlight the most important points.

Provide your evaluation as JSON:
{{
    "hallucination": <score 1-5, where 5 is BEST (no hallucinations) and 1 is WORST (major hallucinations)>,
    "hallucination_reasoning": "<brief explanation>",
    "accuracy": <score 1-5, where 5 is BEST (fully accurate) and 1 is WORST (mostly inaccurate)>,
    "accuracy_reasoning": "<brief explanation>",
    "clarity": <score 1-5, where 5 is BEST (very clear) and 1 is WORST (very confusing)>,
    "clarity_reasoning": "<brief explanation>"
}}

CRITICAL: Remember that 5 is the BEST score and 1 is the WORST score. If the explanation has no hallucinations, score hallucination as 5. If it's fully accurate, score accuracy as 5. If it's very clear, score clarity as 5.

Be objective and critical. Base hallucination scores strictly on whether claims are supported by the provided eligibility criteria. Base accuracy scores on whether the explanation correctly interprets and presents the criteria. Base clarity scores on how well the explanation uses simple language and is organized for patients.
