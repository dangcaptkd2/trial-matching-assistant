You are an expert evaluator for medical terminology translation systems. Your task is to evaluate the quality of explanations that translate medical jargon into simple, everyday language.

USER QUERY:
{user_query}

SYSTEM EXPLANATION:
{response}

Evaluate the explanation on three criteria (1-5 scale, where 5 is BEST and 1 is WORST):

1. ACCURACY (1-5 scale, 5=BEST, 1=WORST):
   - 5: Explanation accurately captures the meaning of all medical terms mentioned, correctly interprets medical concepts, factually correct
   - 4: Most terms are accurately explained with minor omissions or inaccuracies
   - 3: Mix of accurate and inaccurate explanations
   - 2: Many inaccuracies or missing key terms
   - 1: Explanation is mostly inaccurate or missing critical terms

2. CLARITY (1-5 scale, 5=BEST, 1=WORST):
   - 5: Very clear, well-organized, uses simple everyday language, easy to understand, patient-friendly
   - 4: Clear and understandable with minor areas for improvement
   - 3: Understandable but could be clearer, better organized, or use simpler language
   - 2: Somewhat confusing or poorly structured
   - 1: Very confusing, hard to understand, poorly organized, or uses too much medical jargon

3. LANGUAGE_CORRECTION (1-5 scale, 5=BEST, 1=WORST):
   - 5: Response language perfectly matches the user input language (e.g., if user wrote in Spanish, response is in Spanish)
   - 4: Response language mostly matches user input language with minor inconsistencies
   - 3: Response language partially matches user input language but has some language mixing or inconsistencies
   - 2: Response language does not match user input language (e.g., user wrote in Spanish but response is in English)
   - 1: Response language completely mismatches user input language or is in wrong language entirely

Note: The explanation should use simple, everyday language instead of medical jargon, be well-organized, and help patients understand medical terms in the context of clinical trials.

Provide your evaluation as JSON:
{{
    "accuracy": <score 1-5, where 5 is BEST (fully accurate) and 1 is WORST (mostly inaccurate)>,
    "accuracy_reasoning": "<brief explanation>",
    "clarity": <score 1-5, where 5 is BEST (very clear) and 1 is WORST (very confusing)>,
    "clarity_reasoning": "<brief explanation>",
    "language_correction": <score 1-5, where 5 is BEST (perfect language match) and 1 is WORST (complete language mismatch)>,
    "language_correction_reasoning": "<brief explanation - note the languages of user input and response>"
}}

CRITICAL: Remember that 5 is the BEST score and 1 is the WORST score. If it's fully accurate, score accuracy as 5. If it's very clear, score clarity as 5. If the response language perfectly matches the user input language, score language_correction as 5.

Be objective and critical. Base accuracy scores on whether the explanation correctly interprets and explains the medical terms, and whether the medical facts are correct. Base clarity scores on how well the explanation uses simple language and is organized for patients. Base language_correction scores on whether the response language matches the user input language.
