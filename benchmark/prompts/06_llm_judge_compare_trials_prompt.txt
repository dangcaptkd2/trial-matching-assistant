You are an expert evaluator for clinical trial comparison systems. Your task is to evaluate the quality of side-by-side trial comparisons that help patients make informed decisions.

USER INPUT:
{user_input}

TRIAL INFORMATION:
{trial_information}

SYSTEM COMPARISON:
{response}

Evaluate the comparison on four criteria (1-5 scale, where 5 is BEST and 1 is WORST):

1. HALLUCINATION (1-5 scale, 5=BEST, 1=WORST):
   - 5: All information is accurate and grounded in the provided trial information, no made-up claims
   - 4: Mostly accurate, very minor unsupported details
   - 3: Some unsupported claims or embellishments
   - 2: Several hallucinations or made-up trial information
   - 1: Major hallucinations, fabricated trial details, or completely incorrect information

2. ACCURACY (1-5 scale, 5=BEST, 1=WORST):
   - 5: Comparison accurately captures all key differences and similarities between trials, correctly interprets all trial information
   - 4: Most comparisons are accurate with minor omissions or inaccuracies
   - 3: Mix of accurate and inaccurate comparisons
   - 2: Many inaccuracies or missing key comparison points
   - 1: Comparison is mostly inaccurate or missing critical information

3. CLARITY (1-5 scale, 5=BEST, 1=WORST):
   - 5: Very clear, well-organized (table or structured format), easy to compare, patient-friendly, highlights key differences effectively
   - 4: Clear and understandable with minor areas for improvement
   - 3: Understandable but could be clearer, better organized, or use better comparison format
   - 2: Somewhat confusing or poorly structured
   - 1: Very confusing, hard to compare, poorly organized, or unclear format

4. LANGUAGE_CORRECTION (1-5 scale, 5=BEST, 1=WORST):
   - 5: Response language perfectly matches the user input language (e.g., if user wrote in Spanish, response is in Spanish)
   - 4: Response language mostly matches user input language with minor inconsistencies
   - 3: Response language partially matches user input language but has some language mixing or inconsistencies
   - 2: Response language does not match user input language (e.g., user wrote in Spanish but response is in English)
   - 1: Response language completely mismatches user input language or is in wrong language entirely

Note: The comparison should clearly show differences in phase, treatment type, location, visit frequency, eligibility, and other key factors. It should help patients understand which trial might be "less demanding" or better suited.

Provide your evaluation as JSON:
{{
    "hallucination": <score 1-5, where 5 is BEST (no hallucinations) and 1 is WORST (major hallucinations)>,
    "hallucination_reasoning": "<brief explanation>",
    "accuracy": <score 1-5, where 5 is BEST (fully accurate) and 1 is WORST (mostly inaccurate)>,
    "accuracy_reasoning": "<brief explanation>",
    "clarity": <score 1-5, where 5 is BEST (very clear) and 1 is WORST (very confusing)>,
    "clarity_reasoning": "<brief explanation>",
    "language_correction": <score 1-5, where 5 is BEST (perfect language match) and 1 is WORST (complete language mismatch)>,
    "language_correction_reasoning": "<brief explanation - note the languages of user input and response>"
}}

CRITICAL: Remember that 5 is the BEST score and 1 is the WORST score. If the comparison has no hallucinations, score hallucination as 5. If it's fully accurate, score accuracy as 5. If it's very clear, score clarity as 5. If the response language perfectly matches the user input language, score language_correction as 5.

Be objective and critical. Base hallucination scores strictly on whether claims are supported by the provided trial information. Base accuracy scores on whether the comparison correctly identifies and presents differences between trials. Base clarity scores on how well the comparison is organized and helps patients make decisions. Base language_correction scores on whether the response language matches the user input language.
