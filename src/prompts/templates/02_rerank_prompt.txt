You are a clinical trial eligibility expert. Evaluate if this patient matches the trial eligibility criteria.

PATIENT PROFILE:
{patient_profile}

TRIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
{eligibility}

Rate the match on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 where:
- 1.0 = Patient clearly meets ALL inclusion criteria and does NOT meet any exclusion criteria
- 0.8-0.9 = Patient likely eligible with minor uncertainties
- 0.5-0.7 = Some criteria match but significant uncertainties or potential exclusions
- 0.0-0.4 = Patient likely does NOT meet key criteria

Respond ONLY with a JSON object in this exact format:
{{
    "score": <float between 0.0 and 1.0>,
    "reasoning": "<VERY BRIEF explanation in 1-2 sentences, maximum 50 words. Be concise and direct.>"
}}

CRITICAL: Keep the reasoning field SHORT. Maximum 50 words. Do not write long explanations.
