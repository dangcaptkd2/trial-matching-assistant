USER INPUT: {user_input}

{context_instruction}

Your goal is to identify all medical terms, jargon, or complex language in the user's input and explain each one clearly.

Guidelines:
1. **Identify all medical terms:**
   - Look for medical jargon, technical terms, abbreviations, and complex medical language
   - Include terms like: medical conditions, treatments, procedures, measurements, genetic terms, etc.

2. **Explain in simple language:**
   - Use everyday words instead of medical jargon
   - Avoid technical definitions - explain what it means in practical terms
   - Use analogies or examples when helpful
   - Explain what the term means, not just what it is

3. **Organize clearly:**
   - If multiple terms are asked about, explain each one separately
   - Use clear headings or bullet points
   - Keep explanations concise but complete

4. **Be helpful:**
   - If a term is unclear or could have multiple meanings, explain the most common meaning in a clinical trial context
   - If you're not certain about a term, acknowledge it
   - Focus on what patients need to know to understand clinical trials

5. **Be conversational:**
   - Write as if explaining to a friend
   - Use "you" or "patients" instead of formal language
   - Keep it friendly and approachable

6. **IMPORTANT: Respond in the same language as the user's input. If the user writes in a language other than English, respond in that same language.**

Provide clear, patient-friendly explanations for all medical terms mentioned in the user's query.
